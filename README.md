# Tropical_cyclone_CC (EART20361)

### 
The present work examines changes in tropical cyclone intensities mainly in the western North Pacific (WNP) basin for the period 1977-2018. The dataset is constructed from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) dataset v04r00. The trends of annual average in minimum central pressure, annual average in maximum latitude reached, and annual average in the latitude of minimum pressure for WNP typhoons are analysed.
